# More Jeeps

### A simple "game" of counting how many Jeeps you see on a road trip.

Shortly after my son was born, I purchased a 2 door Jeep Wrangler JK and joined a local jeep club to do a little offroading. With that, there were always jeeps around.  Once he could start talking, my son would say "More Jeeps!" every time he saw one while on a drive.

10 years later, it's now a game we still play in the car, where by the end of the trip, the winner is the person who saw the most number of Jeep Wranglers _first_!

## ðŸš™ What is it?
"More Jeeps" is a front end and back end in written in .NET 7. The back end is a traditional WebAPI project and the front end is a Blazor app.
